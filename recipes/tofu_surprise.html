    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>This recipe is great for those looking for a reliable, healthy, and cheap meal. The three main
        ingredients are tofu, rice, and beans - and are best complimented by an array of assorted vegetables such as bell peppers,
        onions, spinach, and zucchini</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Salt and siracha if you desire any flavor in your experience</li>
            <li>Butter or oil for frying tofu and vegetables</li>
            <li>A can of beans</li>
            <li>At least a half cup of rice</li>
            <li>One block of tofu</li>
            <li>One or two bell peppers</li>
            <li>A zucchini</li>
            <li>Spinach</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h4>Steps</h4>    

        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Begin by cooking the rice, as it will take longest. Read the package instructions to determine rice-water ratio, and preferably use a rice cooker.</li>
                <li>Cut up the tofu into small squares as seen in the photo. You can marinate them prior, but this recipe assumes you don't care enough for that. Cut up your vegetables too, except the spinach of course.</li>
                <li>Then, add some oil or butter to a pan, and begin frying the tofu on medium heat, turning it every few minutes to avoid burning.</li>
                <li>After the tofu has begun to brown, add the vegetables and fry until cooked. Generally 15-20 minutes.</li>
                <li>Add the beans towards the end, and stir until they begin to bubble.</li>
                <li>It's now time to combine your frypan ingredients with the rice. Do so in a bowl, or the pan/pot if you're really going for that aesthetic.</li>
                <li>Add siracha and salt if you desire, and enjoy this low cost, average quality meal.</li>
            
            </ol>
