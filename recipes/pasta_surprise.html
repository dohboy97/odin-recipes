    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Another clasic meal - pasta noodles of any variation, whatever veggies you want, and tomato sauce. Is even better when used in alternation with the tofu surprise - so you never get sick of either!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Pasta noodles</li>
        <li>Tomato or pasta sauce</li>
        <li>Assorted vegetables</li>
        <li>Butter or cooking oil</li>
        <li>Salt for taste</li>
        <li>Optional: A source of protein, such as chicken or tofu</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Begin by boiling pasta in a pot.</li>
        <li>While it's boiling, prepare your other ingredients for frying.</li>
        <li>If using chicken, bake it at 375 for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>If using tofu, chop it along with your vegetables, and begin frying it with oil or butter for about ten minutes prior to adding the vegetables, or until browned.</li>
        <li>Add vegetables, and cook until done.</li>
        <li>Add vegetables, protein if used, and pasta together. Add salt for flavor as needed, and mix in pasta sauce for an unextraordinary, yet reliably solid meal</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
